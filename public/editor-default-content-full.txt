Section 1.1: The art of prompting



As of August 2024, there is a multitude of chatbots available on the internet. Some of them, like
ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com, Claude: https://claude.ai and Gemini: https://gemini.google.com (and Llama 3.1, Mistral, ... the list goes on)



have quite impressive reasoning capabilities. 
These models are now multimodal i.e., they 
even accept non-textual input, such as images, sound and video. In principle you can upload a picture of a math exercise and
the chatbot will provide a solution. Well, that is, on a good day and for a not too difficult exercise.

The use of chatbots is encouraged throughout this course. In fact,
they are even allowed during the exam. It is my hope that you will
learn mathematics on a deeper level by communicating with the machine
using carefully designed prompts - see 
the OpenAI guide: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering on prompt engineering.

In some places in the notes, you may see quite specific prompts, such as  
\begin{prompting}
Always answer in the context described below.
Context: I am taking a first semester college level course in introductory mathematics and optimization. Emphasis is on precision and small proofs in mathematics. Please give some conrete examples with mathematics involved. 

- Tell me what a good and precise prompt is.
- Show me two examples of good prompts.
- What is a good prompt if I want to know about code written in Sage or python?
- What is a good prompt if I want to know how to enter some specific mathematics in LaTeX?
\end{prompting} 

*A click on a chatbot link copies the prompt
to the clipboard and takes you to the chatbot, where you can paste the
prompt and get feedback*.

The prompt may also be hidden in a button as below.

\begin{prompting}
Please solve the equation $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$. Guide me through the steps. Make sure that the underlying logic in your arguments is correct.
\end{prompting}

There is a lot of wisdom baked into those weights! In this first
chapter I will show a lot of prompts. In the following chapters less so. Here you are expected to prompt the chatbots on your own.

Be careful! Prompting
without any knowledge of the mathematics can be disastrous. I have seen
exams written by generative AI spanning many pages with little or no relevant mathematical content.
This is known as GIGO or garbage in garbage out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out.
Good prompting comes from an understanding of the mathematics and often resembles concise
and beautifully written instructions.

Section 1.2: Black box warnings



Modern mathematics is perhaps not like
anything you have encountered so far. It calls for a lot of focus and precision, especially when
writing down solutions to problems. It is a bit like programming a computer. There is no room for imprecision and half-baked sentences.

This course amounts to $10$ ECTS or approximately $280$ hours. Suppose that you spend
a week studying for the exam, say $40$ hours. Lectures, exercise classes, and MatLab amount to $14\cdot (4 + 2 + 3)$ hours $= 126$ hours. This leaves around $114$ hours for your own study and immersion. Put in
other terms, you are supposed to work around $8$ hours per week outside classes for this course. With
classes, each week calls for $17$ hours of work. There is a very close relationship between the amount
of hours you log each week and your result at the exam. To state the obvious: numbers don't lie. If you
put in the time, you will almost certainly do well. Try to allocate time for IMO in your weekly
schedule and please (ab)use all the help that is provided.

\begin{prompting}
I am taking a first semester college level mathematics course spanning 14 weeks and 10 ECTS. One ECTS
amounts to 28 hours. The teaching activities every week amount to 4 hours of lectures,
2 hours of exercise sessions and 3 hours of study cafe. I expect that final exam will take 40 hours
of the 10 ECTS. Please schedule a weekly study plan for me along with a plan for the final exam.

A set is a collection of (mathematical) objects or elements. When defining a set we use the symbols $\{$
and $\}$ to denote the beginning and end of its definition. For example, $\{\text{N, i, e, l, s}\}$
is the set of characters in my first name and $\{8, 0\}$ are the digits in the postal code
for Aarhus C. The ordering in the listing of the elements is unimportant so that
$$\begin{aligned}
\{\text{N, i, e, l, s}\} &= \{\text{l, e, i, s, N}\}\\
\{8, 0\} &= \{0, 8\}
\end{aligned}$$
are identical sets. If $S$ is a set, we will use the notation $x\in S$ to denote
that $x$ is an element in $S$. For example, e$\in \{\text{N, i, e, l, s}\}$.

Subsection 1.4.1: The natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ and the integers $\mathbb{Z}$


The set of natural numbers is
$$
\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}.
\tag{1.1}$$
The set of integers is
$$
\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}.
\tag{1.2}$$
These are *infinite* sets, since they contain infinitely many elements as indicated by the dots $\dots$

It makes sense to add and multiply two integers $a$ and $b$. We will denote their
addition or sum as $a + b$ and their multiplication or product as $a b$. A fundamental
fact is that addition and multiplication are commutative i.e., $a + b = b + a$ and
$a b = b a$.

Please notice right away that expressions like $a + b + c$ and $a b c$ are complete nonsense for
three integers $a, b$ and $c$. We only know how to add and multiply two integers, not three. A
wonderful fact comes to our rescue:
$$\begin{aligned}
(a + b) + c &= a + (b + c)\\
(a b) c &= a ( b c).
\end{aligned}\tag{1.3}$$
You get the same result no matter if you start adding (multiplying) $a$ and $b$ or $b$ and $c$ and
then adding (multiplying) $c$ or $a$. So we may write $a + b + c$ and $a b c$ as a
placeholder for one of the two ways of computing this expression in (1.3).

As you can see we use the symbol $+$
for addition, but
no symbol for multiplication. This is the convention in (clean) mathematics as opposed to the $a * b$ coming from
computer algebra (except perhaps in
Mathematica: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Mathematica or Wolfram language, where space is allowed for multiplication).
However, when one of the factors is an actual number, we will use $\cdot$, so that
for example $7$ times $9$ is written as $7\cdot 9$ and $a$ times $3$ is written
$a\cdot 3$.

Subsection 1.4.2: The rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$



The natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ and the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ are well defined
by their representations in (1.1) and (1.2).


Definition 1.7:

A rational number $a/b\in \mathbb{Q}$ 
consists of a numerator $a\in \mathbb{Z}$ and a denominator $b\in \mathbb{N}$.

If $a, c\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b, d\in \mathbb{N}$. Then $a/b$ and
$c/d$ are considered equal i.e.,
$$
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}
$$
if and only if $a d = b c$.

/Definition


Example 1.8:

So there are many different ways of representing a rational number, such as
$$
\frac{3}{7} = \frac{6}{14} = \frac{9}{21}.
$$
Here
$$
\frac{3}{7} = \frac{9}{21}\qquad\text{since}\qquad 3\cdot 21 = 7\cdot 9.
$$
In fact, a fraction stays the same when its numerator and denominator are
multiplied by the same natural number.

/Example

I will assume that you know how to add and multiply fractions,
and that you do not make mistakes like
$$
\color{red}
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1+2}{2+3}=\frac{3}{5}.
$$
In fact, if you temporarily forgot how to add fractions, you can use the wisdom in
Definition (1.7). You can replace $\frac{1}{2}$ by $\frac{3}{6}$ and
$\frac{2}{3}$ by $\frac{4}{6}$ and then add the numerators as in
$$
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{4}{6} = \frac{3 + 4}{6} = \frac{7}{6}.
$$
The computation above says that it is straightforward to add pizza slices of the
same size (one sixth), but that you need to think a bit when adding one half pizza slice and
two pizza slices of size one third. In general,
$$
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a d + b c}{b d}  \qquad\text{and}\qquad
\frac{a}{b} \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a c}{b d}.

Subsection 1.4.3: The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$




Definition 1.10:

A real number is defined by
$$
d_0.d_1 d_2 \dots,
\tag{1.4}$$
where $d_0\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $d_1, d_2, \dots$ is an infinite sequence of integers (digits) in $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.

/Definition

Informally
(1.4) represents the real number
$$
d_0 + \frac{d_1}{10} + \frac{d_2}{100} + \cdots = d_0 + d_1 \cdot 10^{-1} + d_2 \cdot 10^{-2} + \cdots
$$
given by an infinite set of digits as opposed to a rational number, which is
given finitely by an integer (numerator) and a natural number (denominator).
The format in (1.4) is the usual (floating point) output from your pocket calculator or computer algebra system. For example,
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{3} &= 0.333\dots\\
\frac{3}{7} &= 0.42857142857\dots\\
\frac{3}{14} &= 0.21428571428571428571\dots\\
\frac{22}{7}    &= 3.14285714285714285714285714\dots\\
\frac{355}{113} &= 3.14159292035398230088495575\dots\\
\pi             &= 3.14159265358979323846264338\dots
\end{aligned}$$
The decimal expansion of $355/113$ above looks chaotic, but it eventually repeats itself after $112$ digits. In fact the
decimal expansion of every rational number is periodic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal i.e., it repeats itself from a certain point.

In the definition (1.4) of a real number, we are forced to make identifications as
in the definition of a rational number. I will not go into details here, but just notice that the
identification
$$
0.99999\dots = 1.000\dots
$$
is forced upon us: if
$$
x = 9\cdot 10^{-1} + 9\cdot 10^{-2} + \cdots.
$$
Then
$$
10 x = 9 + 9\cdot 10^{-1} + 9\cdot 10^{-2} + \cdots = 9 + x.
$$
Therefore we must have $x = 1$.

A real number that is not rational is called irrational: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number. There are many more irrational numbers
than rational ones. Famous ones are $\sqrt{2}, \pi$ and $e$. The
irrational number $\sqrt{2}$ is a root in the polynomial $x^2-2$ with
integer coefficients (it is an algebraic number: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number). The numbers
$e$ and $\pi$ are not even algebraic (they are transcendental: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number).

Proposition 1.12:

Suppose that $A$ is one of the sets $\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R}$. Then for numbers
$x, y, z$ all in $A$ we have
\begin{enumerate}\item (i) $1\cdot x = x$
\item (ii) $x y = y x$
\item (iii) $x + y = y + x$
\item (iv) $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$
\item (v) $(x y) z = x (y z)$
\item (vi) $x(y + z) = x y + x z$
\end{enumerate}
If $A$ is one of $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R}$, then $0\in A$ 
and for every $x\in A$,  
\begin{enumerate}\item (vii) $x + 0 = x$ 
\item (viii) $x + y = 0$ for some number $y \in A$.
\end{enumerate}  
Finally if $A$ is $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ and $x\in A$ is not $0$,then     
\begin{enumerate}\item (ix) $x z = 1$ for some number $z\in A$.  
\end{enumerate}   
The number $z$ above is called the *inverse* of $x$ and is usually denoted $x^{-1}$.
The number $y$ above is called the *negative* of $x$ and is usually denoted $-x$. We will also
the symbol $-$ (minus) defined as an operation on two numbers $x, y\in A$ as
$$
x - y := x + (-y).

they are just a formal version of what you already know, such as for example, $\pi + 0 = \pi$, $2 + y = 0$
if $y = -2$ and $3 z = 1$ for $z = \frac{1}{3} = 3^{-1}$. Beware however, that the precision
in Proposition (1.12) is necessary when programming

Section 1.5: Propositional logic



A proposition is a (mathematical) statement that is
true ($t$) or false ($f$). This could be a boolean
expression in a computer program, like $1 < 2$.

Sage:



Later we will see propositions with
variables in them like $x < 2$. These are called predicates.

Propositions can be combined into
new (compound) propositions. Take for example the propositions

$$\begin{aligned}
&p: \text{it rains}\\
&q: \text{it is cloudy}.
\end{aligned}$$

Then ($p$ and $q$) is a perfectly good
  new proposition reading *it rains and it is cloudy*. The same goes for (if $p$ then $q$), which reads
  *if it rains then it is cloudy*. The proposition (if $q$ then $p$) reads *if it is cloudy then
    it rains*. This proposition is (clearly) false.

We need some notation to describe these compound propositions:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
p \land q\qquad\qquad & \qquad\qquad p \text{ and } q\\
\\
p \lor q\qquad\qquad & \qquad\qquad p \text{ or } q\\
\\
p\implies q\qquad\qquad & \qquad\qquad \text{if } p \text{ then } q\\
\\
\neg p\qquad\qquad & \qquad\qquad \text{not } p
\end{array}
$$

The compound propositions are either true($t$) or false ($f$) depending on
$p$ and $q$. The dependencies are displayed in the *truth tables* below.


Definition 1.18:

$$
\def\arraystretch{1.2}
      \begin{array}{c|c|c}
        p & q  & p\land q  \\
        \hline

        t & f & f\\
        f & t & f\\
        f & f & f

      \begin{array}{c|c|c}

\boxed{3}\qquad \fcolorbox{black}{red}{\phantom{3}}
\qquad\boxed{4}\qquad \fcolorbox{black}{blue}{\phantom{4}}

with a (natural) number on the front and the color
blue or red on the back.
In (1.5), the first and third cards are shown with their fronts facing up and
the second and fourth cards are shown with their backs facing up.

A claim (proposition) is made that if a card has an even number on the front, then it
must have the color blue on the back.

Your task is to verify this for the cards above. Of course you can
do this by turning all four cards, but is there a way of checking this
by turning less than four cards?

Subsection 1.5.1: Propositional logic as a formal language



The entities $p$ and $q$ above may have
real world interpretations like *it rains* or *it is cloudy*, but we will view them
as variables that can be assigned the values true or false. Independent of this
assignment we define a proposition as follows.


Definition 1.22:

A proposition in the variables $x_1, \dots, x_r$ is an expression involving
the symbols $x_1, \dots, x_r, (, ), \neg, \land, \lor, \implies$ that
can be generated using the rules below
\begin{enumerate}\item (i) The variables $x_1, \dots, x_r$ are (atomic) propositions.
\item (ii) If $P$ is a proposition, then $(\neg P)$ is a proposition.
\item (iii) If $P$ and $Q$ are propositions, then $(P \land Q)$, $(P \lor Q)$ and $(P \implies Q)$ are propositions.
\end{enumerate}

/Definition


Example 1.23:

The expression $(x_1 \implies ((\neg x_2) \lor x_3))$ is a proposition. Let us see how it is generated
using the rules in Definition (1.22).

\begin{enumerate}\item (1)
First, $x_2$ is a proposition using ((i.)).
\item (2)
Then $(\neg x_2)$ is a proposition by using ((ii.)) with $P = x_2$, since we know by ((1.)) that
$P$ is a proposition.
\item (3)
Since $x_3$ is a proposition by ((i.)), it follows
that $((\neg x_2) \lor x_3)$ is a proposition using ((iii.)) with $P = (\neg x_2)$ and $Q = x_3$, since
we know by ((2.)) that $P$ is a proposition.
\item (4)
Finally, since $x_1$ is a proposition by ((i.)) it follows by ((iii.)) with 
$P = x_1$ and $Q = ((\neg x_2)\lor x_3)$ that
$$
(x_1 \implies ((\neg x_2) \lor x_3))
$$
is a proposition, since we know by ((3.)) that $Q$ is a proposition.

Subsection 1.5.2: Truth tables and equivalent propositions



Given a proposition, it makes sense to substitute values ($t$ or $f$) for the variables
and evaluate it using the rules in Definition (1.18), since the
parentheses leave no ambiguity as to how the evaluation must take place. For a given proposition in the
variables $x_1, \dots, x_r$, there are $2^r$ ways of assignments to the set of variables.
Each of these assignments results in the value true or false after evaluation. This
is conveniently recorded in the *truth table* of the proposition as illustrated in the example
below, where $r = 3$ so that the truth table has $2^3 = 8$ rows.


Example 1.25:

The truth tables corresponding to the propositions $(x_1 \land (x_2 \lor x_3))$ and
$((x_1\land x_2) \lor (x_1\land x_3))$ are given below.
$$
\def\arraystretch{1.2}
      \begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
        x_1 & x_2  & x_3 & (x_1 \land (x_2 \lor x_3))  \\
        \hline
        f & f  & f & f    \\ 
        f & f  & t & f   \\
        f & t  & f & f   \\
        f & t  & t & f   \\
        t & f  & f & f   \\
        t & f  & t & t   \\
        t & t  & f & t   \\
        t & t  & t & t
      \end{array}\qquad\qquad
      \begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
        x_1 & x_2  & x_3 & ((x_1\land x_2) \lor (x_1\land x_3))  \\
        \hline
        f & f  & f & f    \\ 
        f & f  & t & f   \\
        f & t  & f & f   \\
        f & t  & t & f   \\
        t & f  & f & f   \\
        t & f  & t & t   \\
        t & t  & f & t   \\
        t & t  & t & t
      \end{array} 
$$
For example, if $x_1 = t, x_2 = f$ and $x_3 = t$, then
$$
(x_1 \land (x_2 \lor x_3)) = (t \land (f \lor t)) = (t \land t) = t
$$
and
$$
((x_1\land x_2) \lor (x_1\land x_3)) = ((t \land f) \lor (t \land t)) = (f \lor t) = t.
$$

/Example

The two propositions in Example (1.25) have identical truth tables. In general,
if two propositions $P$ and $Q$ have identical truth tables we call them *equivalent* and write
$$
P \equiv Q.
$$
In Example (1.25) we saw that
$$
(x_1 \land (x_2 \lor x_3)) \equiv ((x_1\land x_2) \lor (x_1\land x_3)).
$$

The definition below is very important too keep in mind.


Definition 1.26:

The notation $p \iff q$ is used frequently. It means that both
$p\implies q$ and $q\implies p$ are true i.e.,
$$
p \iff q \equiv (p\implies q) \land (q\implies p).
$$

Subsection 1.5.4: Variables, predicates and quantification





Definition 1.29:

A predicate is a proposition depending on one or more variables.

/Definition


Variables are fundamental in computer programs.
In the predicate $x = 1$, $x$ appears as a variable.
Depending on what you substitute
for $x$, the resulting proposition could be true or false or
even meaningless. As an example, the latter case appears if $x$
is replaced by the character 'a'.
This is what computer scientists call a type error. You cannot
compare a character with a digit.


Example 1.30:

If $p(n) = n\ \text{is a prime number}$, then $p(3)$ is true, whereas $p(6)$ is false.
$$
q(m, n) = p(m) \land (\neg p(n))
$$
is a predicate in two variables $m$ and $n$. Here $q(3, 4)$ is true, whereas $q(5, 7)$ is false.

/Example

Subsection: For every $\forall$ and there exists $\exists$



Suppose that we have a predicate $p(x)$, such that $p(x)$ is a proposition for $x\in S$, where
$S$ is some set. Then we define the proposition
$$
\exists x\in S: p(x)
\tag{1.6}$$
to be true if there exists $x\in S$, such that $p(x)$ is true. We let
$$
\forall x\in S: p(x) 
\tag{1.7}$$
be the proposition defined by
$$
\neg (\exists x\in S: \neg p(x)).
$$
In other words, (1.7) says that $p(x)$ is true for every $x\in S$, since
there does not exist $x\in S$ making $p(x)$ false. Le me be absolutely clear.
To show that $\forall x\in S: p(x)$ is false, it is enough to find just a single $x\in S$ so that
$p(x)$ is false.


Example 1.31:

    Here is a statement about real numbers
    $$
    x > 0 \qquad \implies \qquad x^2 > 0.
    \tag{1.8}$$
    This statement reads: no matter which real number $x$ you pick, if $x > 0$,
    then $x^2 > 0$. We definitely want this to be true. Being true means
    that (1.8) must hold for all numbers $x$, also $x = -7$,
    which reads
    $$
    - 7 > 0 \qquad \implies \qquad (-7)^2 = 49 > 0.
    $$
    The above statement is an example of a false implies true statement, which
    we want to be true: even though $-7$ is negative, its square is positive.

In general terms, in proving the statement that $p(x) \implies q(x)$ holds for every $x$ in
    some set $S$, we are really only interested in $x\in S$ for which $p(x)$ is true, since
    $p(x)$ is our assumption. We still need $p(x)\implies q(x)$ to be true for $x\in S$ for
    which $p(x)$ is false. This is assured by the truth table for $\implies$, since 
    $f \implies t$ and $f\implies f$ are both true.

Subsection 1.5.5: Proofs and inference rules



A proof begins with an assumption $P$ and proceeds with a sequence
of logical steps called inference rules leading to a conclusion $Q$.

You
have been taught how to solve equations in steps leading to a solution.
Each step turns out to be an inference rule and the conclusion is
the solution. Let us see how for the simple equation $x + 1 = 2$. Formally
we want to prove
$$
\forall x\in \mathbb{R}: x + 1 = 2 \implies x = 1.
$$
The first inference rule is $a = b \implies a + c = b + c$ i.e., we
are allowed to add the same number to both sides of an equality. This implies
$$
x + 1 = 2 \implies (x+1)-1 = 2 - 1 = 1.
$$
To be very precise we now use Proposition (1.12) ((iv.)) as an inference rule i.e.,
$$
(x + 1) - 1 = 1 \implies x + (1 - 1) = 1.
$$
Then we use Proposition (1.12)((viii.)) to conclude
$$
x + (1 - 1) = 1 \implies x + 0 = 1
$$
and then finally, we get by Proposition (1.12)((vii.)) that
$$
x + 0 = 1 \implies x = 1.
$$
So to solve the equation $x + 1 = 2$, we are actually using four (!) inference rules along the way.

Subsection 1.5.6: The use of implication ($\implies$) and bi-implication ($\iff$)



As you have seen, $\implies$ and $\iff$ are applied to link propositions in a logical argument.  For example,
$$
x + 1 = 2 \iff x = 1\qquad\text{or}\qquad \forall x\in \mathbb{Z}: x + 1 = 2 \iff x = 1.
$$
However, for $x \geq 0 \implies x^2 \geq 0$ we cannot link the two propositions by $\iff$,
simply because $\forall x\in \mathbb{Z}; x^2 \geq 0 \implies x \geq 0$ is false (for $x= -1$).

Subsection 1.5.7: More on mathematical proofs



Most professional mathematicians rarely think about the precise
definition of a proof and would probably feel
uncomfortable defining a proof precisely.
During many years of training they have
assimilated knowledge by experience. Therefore many proofs
seem born out of witchcraft containing several magical
devices.

However, many proofs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_incomplete_or_incorrect_mathematical_proofs appearing in
respected mathematical journals, submitted by respected mathematicians, have turned out to contain
errors. Recent developments in automated proof systems
like Coq: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq and LEAN: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant) show
promise in checking proofs like for example the famous
four color theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem. These automated proof systems
build on dependent type theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type, which we will not go into.

Informally a proof of a proposition $q$, consists in arguing that an implication $p\implies q$ is true by first assuming $p$. Usually this is done
not only through one implication $p\implies q$, but through a series
of intermediate implications
$$
p\implies q_1 \implies q_2 \implies q_3 \implies \cdots \implies q_N,
$$
where the last proposition $q_N$ is $q$. If $p$ is true, this
will constitute a proof that $q_N = q$ is true. Just like in {?}ordwrong{/?},
there is an imprecision here. Can you tell what it is?


Example 1.35:

An integer is called even if it is divisible by $2$. So the even integers are
$$
\{\dots, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, \dots\}.
$$
An integer is called odd if it is not even. So the odd integers are
$$
\{\dots, -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, \dots\}.
$$
Consider the 
proposition:
$$
\forall n\in \mathbb{Z}: p(n)\implies p(n^2),
\tag{1.9}$$
where $p(n) = (n\text{ is odd})$ i.e., the square of an odd
integer is odd. This seems true for a first selection
of examples: $3^2=9, 5^2=25, \dots$.

What does it mean
exactly for a number to be odd? This means that it is
not divisible by $2$ or that there exists another
integer $a$, such that $n = 2 a + 1$. So
$$
p(n) = \exists a\in \mathbb{Z}: n = 2 a + 1.
$$
Therefore we need to show that
$$
\left(\exists a\in \mathbb{Z}: n = 2 a + 1\right) \implies
\left(\exists b\in \mathbb{Z}: n^2 = 2 b + 1\right).
$$
Notice that I had to change $a$ into $b$ in the second proposition above.
The two variables are not the same: $a$ is associated with $n$ and
$b$ is associated with $n^2$.

Let us assume that $n = 2 a + 1$. Now we need to argue that $n^2 = 2 b + 1$ for some $b\in \mathbb{Z}$. You stare at this for a while
and notice that we should use the assumption $n=2 a + 1$ in
computing $n^2$:
$$
n^2 = (2 a + 1)^2 = (2 a)^2 + 2 (2 a) + 1^2 = 4 a^2 + 4 a + 1 =
2(2 a^2 + 2 a) + 1.
$$
Thus, using our assumption we may conclude that if $n = 2 a + 1$, then
$$
n^2 = 2 b + 1,
$$
where $b=2a^2+ 2 a$. This completes the proof.

/Example

The beauty here is that we have verified for all odd natural numbers
that their square is odd. Not just a finite selection like
$3, 7, 11, 13$.

In
many ways a proof is like a detailed argument in a court case, except
that the rules of mathematics are universal. You need the absolute truth
in the court of mathematics (or science).

Subsection 1.5.8: Proof by contradiction



A proposition $p$ is either true or false. This seemingly obvious statement
goes by the name of the law of excluded middle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle and dates back to the writings
of Aristotle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle. The law of excluded middle is key in the example below,
where you are left with the feeling that you have been deprived of a fair and genuine proof.


Example 1.37:

  An irrational number is a (real) number that is not rational. It is a
  startling fact that such numbers exist, but they do! The square root $\sqrt{2}$ of two: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2
  is an example. 
  We will prove that there exists two irrational numbers $\alpha, \beta$, such that
$\alpha^\beta$ is rational.

Consider the proposition $p$ given
  by
  $$
  \gamma = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\text{is rational.}   $$
  Either $p$ is true or false. If $p$ is true we are done putting $\alpha = \beta = \sqrt{2}$. If not, then
  $p$ must be false and $\gamma$ is irrational. But then
  $$
  \gamma^{\sqrt{2}} = \left(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{\sqrt{2}} = (\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}\cdot \sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2
  $$
  and we are done putting $\alpha = \gamma$ and $\beta = \sqrt{2}$.

So which one is it? Is
$$
\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}
$$
rational or irrational? 
  This is really advanced mathematics based on the 
  Gelfond-Schneider theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelfond%E2%80%93Schneider_theorem.

/Example

The law of excluded middle can be turned
into a powerful proof technique called *proof by contradiction*.

Suppose we wish to establish that $p$ is true. Then we turn things upside down by
assuming that $p$ is false i.e., that $\neg p$ is true. If we then
by logical deduction can show that
$$
\neg p \implies q,
$$
for some proposition $q$, which is demonstrably false, then $\neg p$ cannot be true (since
true $\implies$ false is false). Therefore $\neg p$
must be false and $p$ must be true by the law of the excluded middle. This technique is used all the time!


Example 1.38:

Let us use proof by contradiction to show that the proposition $p:$ ($\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number) is true.
Assuming that $p$ is false, we must have that $\neg p$ is true. But
$\neg p$ is the proposition $p_1$ (that $\sqrt{2}$ is a rational number)
$$
\exists m, n\in \mathbb{N}: \sqrt{2} = \frac{m}{n}.
$$
Here $p_1 \iff p_2$, where $p_2$ is the proposition
$$
\exists m, n\in \mathbb{N}: \left(\sqrt{2} = \frac{m}{n}\right) \land ((m \text{ is odd}) \lor (n \text{ is odd})),
$$
since we can assume that $2$ is not a common divisor of $m$ and $n$ by
Definition (1.7).
However,
$$
\sqrt{2} = \frac{m}{n} \iff \sqrt{2} n = m \iff 2 n^2 = m^2 \implies m\text{ is even}.
$$
The last implication above follows from Exercise (1.36). If $m$ is even, then
$m = 2 k$ for some $k\in \mathbb{N}$. Therefore $m^2 = 4 k^2$ and
$$
2 n^2 = 4 k^2 \iff n^2 = 2 k^2
$$
so that $n$ is also even. We have proved that $p_2$ implies the proposition $p_3$ given by
$$
(m \text{ is even}) \land (n \text{ is even}).
$$
Since we are assuming that $p_2$ is true, we must have that $p_3$ is false. However we have
shown that $p_2\implies p_3$ is true. But $t\implies f$ is a  false. Therefore
we must have that $p_2$ is false and therefore that $p_1$ is false. But then
according to the law of the excluded middle, we must have that $p = \neg p_1$ is true.

Propositions are important, but are confined by the binary values
of true and false. We would like to work mathematically with 
objects like integers, floating point numbers, neural networks,
computer programs and so on.

Subsection 1.6.1: Objects and equality



One of the cornerstones of modern mathematics is
deciding when two objects are the same i.e.,
given two objects $A$ and $B$, deciding whether
the proposition $A=B$ is true of false. Oftentimes
an algorithm for evaluating $A=B$ is needed.

You may laugh here, but this is
not always that easy. Even though objects appear different they are the same as
in, for example the propositions
$$
\frac{105}{189} = \frac{35}{63}\qquad\text{and}\qquad \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1.
$$
The first proposition above is an identity of fractions (rational numbers). The second is
an identity, which calls for knowledge of the sine function and real numbers. Each of these
identities calls for some rather advanced mathematics. The first proposition is true in
a very precise way, since $105\cdot 63 = 189 \cdot 35$.


Exercise 1.40:




Use the Sage window above to reason 
about equality in the quiz below. In each case describe the objects i.e.,
are they numbers, symbols, etc.? Also, please check your computations
by hand with the old fashioned paper and pencil, especially $(a+b)(a-b)$.

/Exercise


Exercise 1.41:

You know that $(a+ b)^2 = a^2 + 2 a b + b^2$. Use Sage to find a similar identities
for $(a + b)^3$ and $(a + b)^4$.

\begin{hint}
  Go back and look at (the beginning of) Exercise (1.40).
\end{hint}

/Exercise

For two objects $A$ and $B$ we will use the notation $A \neq B$ for the proposition $\neg (A = B)$.

We have already defined a set (informally) as a collection of distinct objects or *elements*.
We introduce some more set theory here.
A set
is also an object as described in section (1.6.1) and it makes sense to
ask when two sets are equal.


Definition 1.42:

Two sets $A$ and $B$ are equal i.e., $A = B$ if they contain the same elements.

/Definition

An example of a set could be 
the set $\{1,2,3\}$ of natural numbers between $0$ and $4$. Notice again that we use the symbol
"$\{$" to start the listing of elements in a set and the symbol "$\}$" to denote the end of the listing.
Notice also that (by our definition of equality between sets), the order of the elements in the listing does not matter i.e.,
$$
\{1, 2, 3\} = \{2, 3, 1\}.
$$
We are also not allowing duplicates like for
example in the listing $\{1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3\}$ (such a thing is called a multiset: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset).

An example of a set not involving numbers could be the set of letters 
$$
S=\{A, n, e, x, a, m, p, l, c, o, u, d, b, t, h, s, r, i\}
$$ 
used in this sentence. The number of elements in a set $S$ is called the *cardinality* of the set.
We will denote it by $|S|$.

To convince someone beyond a doubt (we will talk about this formally later in this chapter) that two sets $A$ and $B$ are equal, one needs to argue that if $x$ is an element of $A$, then $x$ is an element of $B$ and the other way round, if $y$ is an element of $B$, then $y$ is an element of $A$. If this is true, then
$A$ and $B$ must contain the same elements.


Exercise 1.43:

Give a precise reason as to why the two sets $\{1, 2, 3\}$ and $\{1, 2, 4\}$ are not equal.
Is it possible for a set with $5$ elements to be equal to a set with $7$ elements?

/Exercise  

Sets may be explored using (only) python. This is illustrated in the snippet below.

There is a unique set containing no or zero elements. This set is called the empty set and
is denoted $\emptyset$ i.e.,
$$

Subsection 1.6.2: The symbols $\in$ and $\notin$



The symbol $\in$ is ubiquitous in set theory (and mathematics). If
$A$ is a set, then
$$
x\in A
\tag{1.10}$$
is a proposition. It is true if $x$ *is an element of* or *belongs to* $A$.
The notation
$$
x\notin A
$$
is defined by the proposition $\neg (x\in A)$. Also, as a bit of short hand notation, we will write
$$
a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\in A\qquad\text{for the proposition}\qquad (a_1\in A)\land (a_2\in A)\land \cdots \land (a_n\in A).
$$

Belongs to ($\in$) is straightforward in python.

Subsection 1.6.3: Subsets



If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then <footnote>$A\subseteq B$->At times, the symbol $\subset$ is used instead of $\subseteq$. In our context these two symbols mean the same. However, the notation $A\subsetneq B$ means that $A\subseteq B$ and
  $A\neq B$. For example,
  $\{1, 2, 3\} \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$ and
  $\{1, 2, 3\} \subset \{1, 2, 3\}$.</footnote> means that
every element of $A$ is an element of $B$. So $A\subseteq B$ is a placeholder for the proposition
$$
\forall x\in A : x\in B
$$

In this case we say
that *$A$ is a subset of $B$*. We also use the notation $A\subsetneq B$ to
indicate that $A\subseteq B$ and $A\neq B$. In this case we say that
$A$ is a *strict* subset of $B$.

Subsection 1.6.6: Pairs, triples and tuples



Oftentimes we want to consider more than one variable as
input to a predicate. It is convenient to group the
variables into one object consisting of the variables. This
is done using tuples.

Given two sets $A$ and $B$, we combine
two elements $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ into a pair $(a, b)$, which 
is an element of the Cartesian
  product: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product

$$
A \times B = \{(a, b) \mid a\in A, b\in B\}.
$$
of $A$ and $B$. This is a new set built from $A$ and $B$.


Example 1.63:

If $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{1, 2, 3\}$, then
$$
A\times B = 
\{(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)\}.
$$

/Example


Exercise 1.64:

Consider two pairs $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ each from in $A\times B$. When 
is $(a, b) = (c, d)$?

/Exercise

Python:
The Cartesian product can be computed in python as shown below.




There is no need to restrict ourselves to pairs. We might as well
consider triples $A\times B\times C$ i.e., 
the set of all $(a, b, c)$, where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are sets, or
for that matter general tuples
$$
(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)\in A_1\times A_2\times \cdots \times A_n
\tag{1.13}$$
of any length $n\in \mathbb{N}$, where $a_1\in A_1, a_2\in A_2, 
\dots, a_n\in A_n$. Based on the above example with tuples we have,
$$\begin{aligned}
&\{0\}\times\{1, 2\}\times \{1, 2, 3\} = \\
&\{(0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 1), (0, 2, 2), (0, 2, 3)\}.

You may check this using the python snippet below.

Section 1.7: Ordering numbers



Let us be a little rigorous and introduce the (usual) ordering
on our numbers with addition and multiplication using almost full blown
mathematical formalities. The natural order $<$ on the natural numbers
$\mathbb{N}$ is
$$
1 < 2 < 3 < \cdots
$$
For the numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ it is less obvious how to define an order.
Mathematical simplicity comes to the rescue here. It is enough to define
what (the) positive numbers are! 
We want (the) positive numbers
to satisfy the conditions below.


Definition 1.69:

A subset $A_+$ of positive numbers in a set $A$ of numbers must satisfy
\begin{enumerate}\item (i) For every $x\in A$ one and only one of the following conditions must hold
\begin{enumerate}\item (a) $-x\in A_+$
\item (b) $x = 0$
\item (c) $x\in A_+$
\end{enumerate}
\item (ii) If $x, y\in A_+$, then $x + y\in A_+$ and $x y\in A_+$.
\end{enumerate}
For a set $A_+$ of positive numbers in $A$, we define
$$
x < y \iff y - x\in A_+
$$
and
$$
x\leq y \iff (x = y) \lor (x < y).
$$
We will write $x > 0$ if $x\in A_+$ and $x < 0$ if $-x\in A_+$.

/Definition


Remark 1.70:

Notice that we only use arithmetic operations to define orders on
numbers in Definition (1.69).
This is also how computers compare numbers algorithmically. Also if $A = \mathbb{Z}$,
putting $A_+ = \mathbb{N}$ makes all of the conditions in Definition (1.69)

Subsection 1.7.1: Ordering $\mathbb{Z}$



As we saw in Remark (1.70), the natural order on $\mathbb{Z}$ is
defined by $\mathbb{Z}_+ = \mathbb{N}$, so that $x < y$ if $y-x\in \mathbb{N}$ for $x, y\in \mathbb{Z}$.
This completely agrees with our preconception that
$$
\cdots < -3 < -2 < -1 < 0 < 1 < 2 < \cdots
\tag{1.14}$$

To be precise, writing $\cdots < -3 < -2 < -1 < 0 < 1 < 2 < \cdots$ is nonsense, since $<$ is only defined for two integers.

We define the positive rational numbers as
$$
\mathbb{Q}_+ = \left\{\frac{m}{n} \in \mathbb{Q} \middle| m > 0\right\} = \left\{1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \dots \right\}.

get


Proposition 1.74:

For $\cfrac{a}{b},\,\,\, \cfrac{c}{d}\in \mathbb{Q}$,
$$
\frac{a}{b}\, < \frac{c}{d}\qquad \iff\qquad a d < b c\qquad (\text{in }\mathbb{Z}).
$$

/Proposition
\begin{proof}
We must check when
$$
\frac{c}{d} - \frac{a}{b} = \frac{b c - a d}{b d} \in \mathbb{Q}_+.
$$
This happens precisely when the numerator $b c - a d\in \mathbb{N}$ or $b c - a d > 0$. Therefore
the condition in the proposition is satsified.

For the
real numbers we define the positive numbers as
$$
\mathbb{R}_+ = \{x\in \mathbb{R} \mid x = d_0.d_1 d_2 \dots, d_0 \geq 0, x \neq 0\}.

Even though we have not precisely defined addition and multiplication of

satisfies the conditions of Definition (1.69).

One may prove that for every $x, y\in \mathbb{R}_+$, there exists
$N\in \mathbb{N}$, such that $N x > y$. This is the
archimedean property of the real numbers.

One other
crucial property is the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$. It says
that a non-empty subset $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with an upper bound $B$
i.e., $\forall x\in S: x\leq B$, always has
a smallest upper bound. The rational numbers do not
share this property, since for example

S = \{x\in \mathbb{Q} \mid x^2 < 2\}

does not have a smallest upper bound inside $\mathbb{Q}$.

Section 1.8: Proof by induction



A <footnote>precocious Gauss->See the article Gauss's Day of Reckoning: https://www.americanscientist.org/article/gausss-day-of-reckoning for some history of this anecdote.</footnote>  proved the formula
$$
1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\tag{1.15}$$
at the age of seven displaying remarkable ingenuity for his age. Lesser
mortals usually use induction to prove this formula. Gauss was asked
along with his classmates to compute the sum of all natural numbers
$1, 2, \dots, 100$. Using his formula he quickly came up with the correct
answer $5050$. His classmates had to work for the entire lesson. 

Suppose that the formula in (1.15) is viewed as a
proposition $p(n)$. To prove the formula we need to prove it for all
natural numbers (you can easily see that $p(1)$ and $p(2)$ are true) i.e.,
we need to prove
$$
\forall n\in \mathbb{N}: p(n).
$$
An induction proof is a way of proving this statement by showing two things:
\begin{enumerate}\item (i)
  $p(1)$
\item (ii)
  $\forall n\in \mathbb{N}: p(n)\implies p(n+1)$
\end{enumerate}
These two statements ensure that $p(1) \implies p(2)$. Therefore
$p(2)$ must be true, since we assumed $p(1)$ true from the
beginning. Similarly $p(2)\implies p(3)$ ensures that $p(3)$
is true and so on. In fact we have proved $p(n)$ for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$
using this technique. One can prove this using proof by
contradiction and that every non-empty subset
of $\mathbb{N}$ has a first element. In general if $S$ is a subset of set with an order $\leq$, then
$s\in S$ is called a first element if
$$
\forall x\in S: s \leq x.
$$
A crucial rule (or axiom) is that every non-empty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has
 a first element! Notice that this is false for $\mathbb{Z}$.


Theorem 1.82:

  Suppose that $p(n)$ are infinitely many propositions given by $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Then
  $$
  \forall n\in \mathbb{N}: p(n)
  $$
  is true if
\begin{enumerate}\item (i)
  $p(1)$ is true.
\item (ii)
  $\left(\forall n\in \mathbb{N}: p(n)\implies p(n+1)\right)$ is true.
\end{enumerate}

/Theorem

\begin{proof}
Suppose by contradiction that there exists $n\in \mathbb{N}$, such that
$p(n)$ is false. Then the subset
$$
S = \{n\in \mathbb{N} \mid \neg p(n)\}\subseteq \mathbb{N}
$$
is non-empty. Therefore it has a first element $n_0\in S$. 
Here $n_0 > 1$, since $p(1)$ is assumed to be true. So we
know that $p(n_0-1)$ is true and that
$p(n_0-1)\implies p(n_0)$ is true. But the latter
implication is a contradiction, since true implies
false is false.
\end{proof}



Let us see how an induction proof plays out in the above example
with the statement $p(n)$ that
$$
1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
\tag{1.16}$$
Clearly $p(1)$ is true. We need to prove $p(n)\implies p(n+1)$, so
we assume that $p(n)$ holds i.e., that (1.16) is true.
Then we may add $n+1$ to both sides of (1.16) to get
$$
1 + 2 + \cdots + n + (n+1) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n+1).
$$
Here the right hand side can be rewritten as
$$
\frac{n(n+1) + 2(n+1)}{2} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2},
$$
which is exactly what we want. This is the conjectured formula for
the sum of the numbers $1, 2, \dots, n, n+1$. Therefore
we have proved that $p(n)\implies p(n+1)$ and the induction
proof is complete.


Example 1.83:

  For a real number $r\neq 1$, the extremely useful formula
  $$
  1 + r + \cdots + r^n = \frac{1 - r^{n+1}}{1-r}
  \tag{1.17}$$
  holds. Let us prove this formula by induction. For $n=1$ this amounts to the identity
  $$
  1 + r = \frac{1-r^2}{1-r},
  $$
  which is true since $1-r^2 = (1+r)(1-r)$. We let $p(n)$ denote
  the identity in (1.17). We have seen that $p(1)$ is true. The induction step
  consists in proving $p(n)\implies p(n+1)$. We can prove this
  by adding $r^{n+1}$ to the right hand side in (1.17):
  $$
  \frac{1 - r^{n+1}}{1-r} + r^{n+1} = \frac{1 - r^{n+1} + (1-r) r^{n+1}}{1-r} = \frac{1 - r^{n+2}}{1-r}.
  \tag{1.18}$$
Real life application:
    In order to pay for a house you borrow $P$ DKK at an interest of
    $r$ per year. You want to pay off your debt over $N$ years by
    paying a fixed amount each year. How much is the fixed yearly
    amount you need to pay?

Let us analyze the setup: suppose that the fixed yearly amount
    is $Y$. We will find an equation giving us $Y$ in terms of
    $P, N$ and $r$. Put $q = 1+ r$.

After one year you owe
    $$
    q P - Y.
    $$
    After two years you owe
    $$
    q(q P - Y) - Y.
    $$
    After three years you owe
    $$
    q ( q ( q P - Y) - Y) - Y.
    $$
    In general after $n$ years you owe
    $$
    q^n P - Y (1 + q + \cdots + q^{n-1}).
    $$
    Since we want to be debt free after $N$ years, the yearly payment will have to satisfy
    $$
    q^N P = Y ( 1 + q + \cdots + q^{N-1}).
    $$
    By the formula (1.17), we get
    $$
    q^N P = Y \frac{1-q^N}{1-q}.
    $$
    Here $Y$ can be isolated giving the formula
    $$
    Y = \frac{r P}{1 - \left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)^N}.
    $$ 
    With the current (August 2024) interest rate around four percent, you pay a fixed monthly
    amount of around 4770 DKK (down from 5420 DKK in 2023, when the interest rate was five percent) for borrowing one million DKK over $30$ years.

Section 1.9: The concept of a function



A function is a crucial concept in mathematics. In Sage (actually python here) a simple function can be
programmed like



The code above seems to take a number and returns the number plus one. This (f) is in fact a function 
taking as *input* a number and returning as *output* the number plus one. Notice that
we do not even know which numbers we are talking about here. In mathematics we need to have
a more precise notion of a function. 

The above python function could more formally be denoted as $f: \mathbb{Z}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ with
$f(n) = n+1$ if we are dealing with the integers, but we cannot tell from the code.

Well, to be fair ...:
To be completely fair, it is possible from Python 3.5 to add type annotations to functions, so that we could write
<code>def f(n: int) -&gt; int: return(n+1)
</code>


in the Python code to state that the function should take values in the integers and return integers.


The precise mathematical definition of a function in terms of sets is
the following. A function $f: S\rightarrow T$ is a subset
$f\subseteq S\times T$, such that
$(s, t_1)\in f \land (s, t_2)\in f \implies t_1 = t_2$. In words it states that a
function $f: S\rightarrow T$ is a subset $f$ of $S\times T$, containing pairs
having only one second coordinate for every first coordinate.

The everyday working definition of a
function is more intuitive: a machine taking input from some set
$S$ and giving output in some set $T$. The uniqueness of the output
is encoded in the mathematical definition of a function.


Definition 1.90:

Mathematically a function $f$ takes values from a set $S$ and returns values in a set $T$. In details,
it is denoted $f: S\rightarrow T$ and the value associated with $s\in S$ is denoted $f(s)\in T$.
Here $S$ is called *the domain* of $f$ and $T$ is called *the codomain* of $f$. Less,
formally $S$ is called the input set and $T$ the output set for $f$.

/Definition


Remark 1.91:

  Please notice that a function is a very, very general concept. It is not just something
  that you draw as a graph on a piece of paper. Of course, you can draw a function
  $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ like $f(x) = x^2$:
  
  Generally, a function $f: S\rightarrow T$ is given by a machine, formula or algorithm that
  computes $f(x)\in T$ for every $x\in S$. Nothing more, nothing less. It really has nothing to
  do with a graph (even though graphs can sometimes be useful for visualizing certain functions like $f(x) = x^2$).

/Remark


Example 1.92:

  Good examples of functions can be found in the cryptographic hash functions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function. They are examples of complicated functions $f:S \rightarrow T$, where
  $S$ is infinite and $T$ finite. Here $S$ could be data like plain text files and $T$ could be
  a $256$ bit number. This is the setup for the widely used sha-256 cryptographic hash function.
  The whole point of a cryptographic hash function is that it must be humanly impossible to
  <footnote>compute $y$ with $f(y) = f(x)$ given $f(x)$->A pair $x\neq y$ with $f(x) = f(y)$ is called a collision</footnote>. 
  In fact, sha-256 is used in the Bitcoin block chain. The precise definition of
  sha-256 can be found in FIPS PUB 180-4: http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf approved by the Secretary of Commerce.

Other interesting functions output a bounded size digital footprint (checksum) of a file (like md5: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5). This is very useful
for checking data integrity of downloads over the internet. The md5 hash is a $128$ bit number.

Instead of listing $256$ or $128$ bits for the hash value one uses hexadecimal notation with digits
in 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 , a, b, c, d, e, f. A pair of hexadecimal digits then represents
a byte or $8$ bits. Output from sha-256 and md5 consist of $64$ and $32$ hexadecimal
digits respectively. You are welcome to experiment with these two hash functions in the
Sage window below.

(1.90). Two functions $f, g$ are the same when
they have the same domain $S$ and codomain $T$ and
$f(x) = g(x)$ for every $x\in S$.


Example 1.94:

The functions $f_1: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $f_2: \{x\in \mathbb{R} \mid x\geq 0\}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
given by $f_1(x) = x^2$ and $f_2(x) = x^2$ are not the same! Their domains
are different.

/Example

Subsection 1.9.2: Notations for defining a function



If $f: S\rightarrow T$ is a function and $S$ is a finite set, then you can
define $f$ using a simple table. This is best illustrated using an
example. Suppose that $S = \{1, 2, 3\}, T = \mathbb{R}$ and
$$\begin{aligned} 
  f(1) &= \sqrt{2}\\
  f(2) &= \pi\\
  f(3) &= -1.
\end{aligned}$$
Then $f$ is expressed in table form as
$$
\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}
x & 1 & 2 & 3\\ \hline
f(x) & \sqrt{2} & \pi & -1
\end{array}
$$

Very often the bracket (or *Tuborg* in Danish) notation is used. It is
similar to if-then-else statements in programming:
$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  0 &\text{if } x\leq 0\\
  x^2 &\text{if } x > 0
\end{cases}
\tag{1.19}$$
defines the function $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that outputs $0$ if the
input $x\leq 0$ and $x^2$ if $x>0$. In python we may express this as




Exercise 1.95:

What is $f(-17)$ and $f(17)$ for the function defined in (1.19). Draw
the graph of $f$. Come up with a function $f:S\rightarrow T$, where it
does not make sense to draw a graph.

Subsection 1.9.3: Composition of functions



Given two functions $f: S\rightarrow T$ and $g: U\rightarrow V$, where
$V\subseteq S$, we define a new function $f\circ g: U \rightarrow T$ by
$$
(f\circ g)(u) = f(g(u)).
$$
This notion calls for some reflection. We have a total of four sets
in this definition: $U, V, S$ and $T$ and, not to forget, the condition that
$V\subseteq S$. If this last condition was not satisfied it would be
meaningless to apply the function $f$ to $g(u)$.
I hope the diagram below helps the
understanding.




Remark 1.96:

  The concept of a function is powerful and underlies functional programming in computer science: every computation can be realized as applying a composition of functions to an argument. This is exemplified in the computer language
  Haskell: https://www.haskell.org/.

Subsection 1.9.6: The inverse function



If $f:S\rightarrow T$ is bijective, then we may define a function $g: T\rightarrow S$, so
that $(f\circ g)(y) = y$ for every $y\in T$ and $(g\circ f)(x)$ for every $x\in S$. This
function is denoted $f^{-1}$.

How do we define $f^{-1}(y)$ for $y\in T$? Well, since $f$ is surjective, we may find
$x\in S$ so that $y = f(x)$. Now, we simply define
$$
f^{-1}(y) = x.
\tag{1.20}$$
We cannot have $x_1 \neq x_2$ in $S$ with $f(x_1) = f(x_2) = y$, since $f$ is injective. We only have one choice for
$x$ in (1.20). Therefore (1.20) really is a good and sound definition.


Example 1.107:

Let $f: S\rightarrow S$, where $S = \{1, 2, 3\}$ be given by
the table
$$
\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}
x & 1 & 2 & 3\\ \hline
f(x) & 3 & 1 & 2

Then $f^{-1}$is given by the table
$$

x & 1 & 2 & 3\\ \hline

Subsection 1.9.8: Neural networks



Having defined functions and composition of functions, we can deflate
the term (deep) neural network, which is often clouded in
magic and mystery.

A *neural network* is a special case of a function
$$
f: A\rightarrow B,
\tag{1.21}$$
where $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ and $B\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. Neural networks are
often compositions of many intermediate functions called
(hidden) layers.


Remark 1.114:

Recall from Definition (1.99) that a function such as (1.21) can
be written
$$
f(x_1, \dots, x_m) = \left(
f_1(x_1, \dots, x_m), \dots, f_n(x_1, \dots, x_m)\right),
\tag{1.22}$$
where $f_1, \dots, f_n$ are functions $A\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Check out
Example (1.100).

/Remark

In a neural
network the functions $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n$ are viewed as <footnote>neurons->To be precise, the functions should be viewed as synapses: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse</footnote>. Depending on their
input they either fire or do not fire a signal. Classically this is
modelled by the perceptron: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron,
which is a function $p:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ of the form
$$
p(x_1, \dots, x_n) =
\begin{cases}
  1 &\text{if } w_1 x_1 + \cdots + w_n x_n > b\\
  0 &\text{if } w_1 x_1 + \cdots + w_n x_n \leq b
\end{cases}
\tag{1.23}$$
  for fixed numbers $w_1, \dots, w_n$ (called weights) and a number $b$ (called the threshold).
  If the weighted sum $w_1 x_1 + \cdots + w_n x_n$ is above the threshold, the neuron
  fires (returns the value $1$). If not it does not fire (returns the value $0$).




Exercise 1.115:

  Consider the three perceptrons $p_1, p_2, p_3: \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where
  $$
p_1(x, y) =
\begin{cases}
  1 &\text{if } -x-y > -\frac{3}{2}\\
  0 &\text{if } -x-y \leq -\frac{3}{2}
\end{cases},
\qquad
p_2(x, y) =
\begin{cases}
  1 &\text{if } x + y > \frac{1}{2}\\
  0 &\text{if } x + y \leq \frac{1}{2}
\end{cases},
$$
and
$$
p_3(x, y) =
\begin{cases}
  1 &\text{if } x + y > \frac{3}{2}\\
  0 &\text{if } x + y \leq \frac{3}{2}
\end{cases}.
$$
Let $f(x, y) = p_3 (p_1(x, y), p_2(x, y))$. Then $f$ is
a composite function $f = g\circ h$ of two functions $h: \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$
and $g: \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Write down these functions.

Hint:
Have a closer look at (1.22) in order to understand how
functions from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$ are expressed. Notice that
our notation is a bit inconsistent when it comes to types. For example,
the function $p_1:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ should really be
denoted $p_1((x, y))$ instead of $p_1(x, y)$, since it takes input from
$\mathbb{R}^2 = \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}$. This is remedied in the (hopefully easy to understand) python code below.


\begin{prompting}
Explain the python code below to me.

def p1(v):
    (x, y) = v
    if -x-y &gt; -3/2:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

def p2(v):
    (x, y) = v
    if x + y &gt; 1/2:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

def p3(v):
    (x, y) = v
    if x+y &gt; 3/2:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

def h(v):
    return (p1(v), p2(v))

def g(v):
    return p3(v)

def f(v):
    return g(h(v))

\end{prompting}



Compute
$f(0, 0), f(1, 0), f(0, 1)$ and $f(1, 1)$.

Relate the perceptrons $ p_1 $ and $ p_2 $ to the illustration
below. What do you think the red and blue line illustrate?  What does
it mean that a dot is solid compared to hollow? What is special
about points between the red and blue lines?  Try to relate $f(0,0),
f(1,0), f(0,1)$ and $f(1,1)$ to the illustration.

Mathematically there is no reason to use special functions such as perceptrons in each node. One also uses
  a (smooth) version of the perceptron employing the sigmoid function: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function.
  With the notation above, this function is given as
  $$
  \sigma(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w_1 x_1 + \cdots + w_n x_n) - b}}.
  $$
  However, around 2011 it was observed that the perceptron activation function (ReLU: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) as defined in (1.23) led to better training
  of deep neural networks.
