Section 1.1: The art of prompting



As of August 2024, there is a multitude of chatbots available on the internet. Some of them, like
ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com, Claude: https://claude.ai and Gemini: https://gemini.google.com (and Llama 3.1, Mistral, ... the list goes on)



have quite impressive reasoning capabilities. 
These models are now multimodal i.e., they 
even accept non-textual input, such as images, sound and video. In principle you can upload a picture of a math exercise and
the chatbot will provide a solution. Well, that is, on a good day and for a not too difficult exercise.

The use of chatbots is encouraged throughout this course. In fact,
they are even allowed during the exam. It is my hope that you will
learn mathematics on a deeper level by communicating with the machine
using carefully designed prompts - see 
the OpenAI guide: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering on prompt engineering.

In some places in the notes, you may see quite specific prompts, such as  
\begin{prompting}
Always answer in the context described below.
Context: I am taking a first semester college level course in introductory mathematics and optimization. Emphasis is on precision and small proofs in mathematics. Please give some conrete examples with mathematics involved. 

- Tell me what a good and precise prompt is.
- Show me two examples of good prompts.
- What is a good prompt if I want to know about code written in Sage or python?
- What is a good prompt if I want to know how to enter some specific mathematics in LaTeX?
\end{prompting} 

*A click on a chatbot link copies the prompt
to the clipboard and takes you to the chatbot, where you can paste the
prompt and get feedback*.

The prompt may also be hidden in a button as below.

\begin{prompting}
Please solve the equation $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$. Guide me through the steps. Make sure that the underlying logic in your arguments is correct.
\end{prompting}

There is a lot of wisdom baked into those weights! In this first
chapter I will show a lot of prompts. In the following chapters less so. Here you are expected to prompt the chatbots on your own.

Be careful! Prompting
without any knowledge of the mathematics can be disastrous. I have seen
exams written by generative AI spanning many pages with little or no relevant mathematical content.
This is known as GIGO or garbage in garbage out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out.
Good prompting comes from an understanding of the mathematics and often resembles concise
and beautifully written instructions.

Exercise 1.1:

Study
the OpenAI guide: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering on prompt engineering.

Then come up with prompts that make a chatbot act like a mathematics tutor for you.
Here is a small example that you may extend.
\begin{prompting}
Please act like a friendly tutor and teach me about the derivatives of simple functions. Test my understanding after each concept you explain.
\end{prompting}

Exercise 1.2:

Start your $\LaTeX$ journey using the prompt below.
\begin{prompting}
I am doing weekly exercises in mathematics at the college level. Please suggest a very simple template in
LaTeX for hand in of these exercises. Also, show me how to typeset an equation in LaTeX.

There seems to be a web interface to LaTeX called Overleaf. Please tell me how to access this so that I can
enter a weekly exercise.
\end{prompting}

Come up with your own prompt for a question related to software.

Exercise 1.3:

Below I ask for feedback from the chatbot on some dubious chunk of mathematics.
\begin{prompting}
Please give feedback on the mathematics contained in the $\LaTeX$ below in triple quotes. Emphasize logic and precision.
"""
$$
x^2 = 1 \implies x = 1
$$
From this it follows that $1 + 1 = 3$.
"""
\end{prompting}

Insert your own mathematics in $\LaTeX$ notation and ask for feedback in a prompt.

Section 1.2: Black box warnings



Modern mathematics is perhaps not like
anything you have encountered so far. It calls for a lot of focus and precision, especially when
writing down solutions to problems. It is a bit like programming a computer. There is no room for imprecision and half-baked sentences.

This course amounts to $10$ ECTS or approximately $280$ hours. Suppose that you spend
a week studying for the exam, say $40$ hours. Lectures, exercise classes, and MatLab amount to $14\cdot (4 + 2 + 3)$ hours $= 126$ hours. This leaves around $114$ hours for your own study and immersion. Put in
other terms, you are supposed to work around $8$ hours per week outside classes for this course. With
classes, each week calls for $17$ hours of work. There is a very close relationship between the amount
of hours you log each week and your result at the exam. To state the obvious: numbers don't lie. If you
put in the time, you will almost certainly do well. Try to allocate time for IMO in your weekly
schedule and please (ab)use all the help that is provided.

\begin{prompting}
I am taking a first semester college level mathematics course spanning 14 weeks and 10 ECTS. One ECTS
amounts to 28 hours. The teaching activities every week amount to 4 hours of lectures,
2 hours of exercise sessions and 3 hours of study cafe. I expect that final exam will take 40 hours
of the 10 ECTS. Please schedule a weekly study plan for me along with a plan for the final exam.

Exercise 1.4:

Prompt a chatbot with
\begin{prompting}
What is 
$$
-\sqrt{\frac{1}{2} (1 - \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3 - 2\sqrt{2}})}
$$
\end{prompting}

and explain why the output from WolframAlpha is weird.
Use prompting to make it explain the mathematics input notation.

Finally use your own mental powers (and feedback from the
chatbot) to explain what the proper output should have been.

\begin{hint} 
  $$ 
  3 - 2 \sqrt{2} = (\sqrt{2} - 1)^2.  
  $$

We will use the computer algebra system
Sage: https://www.sagemath.org/ in exploring and experimenting
with mathematics. This means that you will have to write small
commands and code snippets.

Sage is built on top of the very wide
spread language
python: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)
and you can in fact enter <footnote>Python code->One may also enter code in several other languages</footnote> in
the Sage input windows in the interactive notes. First adjust the prompt below
according to your needs and get feedback from an LLM.

\begin{prompting}
I am taking a mathematics course that uses the computer algebra system Sage.
The course uses the browser, where I can enter and run small snippets of code in Sage and python.
I have no/some/extensive prior programming experience.
Give me a brief introduction to Sage and explain how it relates to python.
Finish your reply with a small exercise I can do. 
If no/some/extensive is present above in this prompt, remark this and only reply with
Please select your programming experience.
\end{prompting}

Below is an example of a basic
graphics command in Sage.  Push the Compute button to evaluate.



You can install Sage on your own computer following the instructions on
https://www.sagemath.org/: https://www.sagemath.org/.

Exercise 1.5:

Did you notice that you can edit and enter new commands in the Sage window?
Do the following problems using Sage based on the Sage guided tour: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/tour.html. 

\begin{enumerate}\item (i) Consider $f(x) = x \sin(1/x)$. Plot the graph of $f$ from $0$ to $0.1$. Computing $f(0)$ does not make sense. Do you
  see a way of assigning a natural value to $f(0)$ using the graph?
\item (ii) Find an approximate solution with four decimals to the equation $\cos(x) = x$.

\begin{hint}
    This is an example of an equation, that can only be solved numerically.
    Try first plotting the graph of $f(x) = x - \cos(x)$ from $0$ to $1$. Then use a
    suitable function from the Sage guide.
    \end{hint}
\item (iii) Compute $\pi$ with $100$ decimals.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{prompting}
Give me the sage code to compute pi with 100 decimals. I want a one line command.
